My journey into the world of git and GitHub, where I will try to answer the following questions:

1. Why would I use git and GitHub?
2. What can I put into a public git repositorie?
3. How should I incorporate it into my daily routines?

To try to answer these questions in no perticular order:

I should learn to use a distributed versioning system ahead of the time I really need
to use it, which means that using it as much as possible will give me a lot of
practice.

What kind of tools should I use in tandem with git and github?
